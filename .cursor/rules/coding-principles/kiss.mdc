# KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones.
- Simple code is easier to understand, test, debug, and maintain.
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction, premature optimization, or over-engineering.
- Choose straightforward implementations unless complexity is justified by clear requirements.
- If a simpler approach solves the problem adequately, use it.
