# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
- Define interfaces based on high-level needs, not low-level implementations.
- Use dependency injection to provide concrete implementations at runtime.
