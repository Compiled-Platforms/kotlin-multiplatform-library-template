# Composition over Inheritance

- Favor object composition over class inheritance to achieve code reuse.
- Inheritance creates tight coupling and rigid hierarchies.
- Composition provides flexibility and allows behavior to be assembled from independent components.
- Use interfaces and dependency injection to combine behaviors.
- Inheritance should be reserved for true "is-a" relationships, not just code reuse.
