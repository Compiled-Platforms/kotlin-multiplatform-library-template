- Use version control for all changes; do not work outside tracked history.
- Preserve history quality: prefer clean reverts or fixes over piling on ad-hoc commits.
- When adding, updating, or removing dependencies, check if `.gitignore` needs updates for library-specific caches, generated files, or platform artifacts.
