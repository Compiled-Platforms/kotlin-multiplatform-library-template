- Use version control for all changes; do not work outside tracked history.
- Make small, logical commits that represent a single coherent change.
- Write clear commit messages that explain intent (“why”), not just implementation (“what”).
- Do not mix unrelated changes in the same commit.
- Do not commit broken builds, failing tests, or incomplete work unless explicitly marked and isolated.
- Keep diffs reviewable: minimize noise and separate mechanical refactors from behavioral changes.
- When behavior changes, update relevant tests and documentation in the same change.
- Preserve history quality: prefer clean reverts or fixes over piling on ad-hoc commits.
