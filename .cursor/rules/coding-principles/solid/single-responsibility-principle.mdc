description: This rule provides standards for Single Responsibility Principle ensuring each unit has one reason to change
alwaysApply: true
---
- Each function, class, or module should have one reason to change.
- Avoid combining multiple responsibilities in a single unit.
- Split code when a unit starts coordinating unrelated concerns.
- Name functions and types to reflect a single, well-defined responsibility.
- Prefer composition over large, multi-purpose abstractions.
