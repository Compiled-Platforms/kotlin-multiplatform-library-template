- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): each function, class, or module should have one reason to change.
- Avoid combining multiple responsibilities (e.g., business logic, I/O, state management, formatting) in a single unit.
- Split code when a unit starts coordinating unrelated concerns.
- Name functions and types to reflect a single, well-defined responsibility.
- Prefer composition over large, multi-purpose abstractions.
