- Make small, logical commits that represent a single coherent change.
- Write clear commit messages that explain intent ("why"), not just implementation ("what").
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automated versioning: `fix` = PATCH, `feat` = MINOR, `BREAKING CHANGE` = MAJOR
- Do not mix unrelated changes in the same commit.
- Do not commit broken builds, failing tests, or incomplete work unless explicitly marked and isolated.
