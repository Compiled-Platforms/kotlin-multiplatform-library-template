# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.
- Create focused, specific interfaces rather than large, general-purpose ones.
- Split large interfaces into smaller, cohesive interfaces based on client needs.
- Avoid empty or no-op implementations that indicate interface bloat.
