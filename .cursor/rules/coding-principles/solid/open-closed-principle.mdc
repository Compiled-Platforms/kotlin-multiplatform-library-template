# Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- Add new functionality through inheritance, composition, or interfaces without changing existing code.
- Use abstractions and dependency injection to enable extension points.
- Avoid modifying stable, tested code when adding features.
