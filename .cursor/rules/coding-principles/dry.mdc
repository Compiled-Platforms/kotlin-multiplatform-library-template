# DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Every piece of knowledge should have a single, unambiguous representation in the system.
- Avoid duplicating code or logic across the codebase.
- Extract common patterns into reusable functions, classes, or modules.
- If you need to change something, you should only need to change it in one place.
- Duplication increases maintenance burden and the likelihood of inconsistent behavior.
