# YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)

- Don't implement functionality until it's actually needed.
- Avoid building features based on speculation about future requirements.
- Every line of code has a maintenance cost; don't add unnecessary code.
- Focus on current, concrete requirements rather than hypothetical future needs.
- If a feature is truly needed later, it can be added then with better information.
