# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering program correctness.
- Derived classes should extend, not replace, the behavior of base classes.
- Preserve preconditions, postconditions, and invariants of the base type.
- Avoid throwing new exceptions or requiring stronger preconditions in subtypes.
